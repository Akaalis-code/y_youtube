##### For Text generation , below is the OLLAMA setup 

   0) PIP setup if you dont already have it :
         > sudo apt install python3-pip

   1) OLLAMA tools setup in your system , and some other basic commands : 

         > curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh      -->> ollama gets installed in your system and starts some services
            http://localhost:11434/                           -->> In this url its saying ollama running , need to figureout how to stop it ,
                                                                  other than using systemctl
         > systemctl stop ollama.service                     -->> This is stopping ollama , need to figure out how to restart again
         > ollama serve                                      -->> To start local ollama server

   2) Getting OLLAMA model of your choice and running it locally :
   
         > ollama run <your_model_choice>                    -->> Through ollama the model gets downloaded and installed and starts running in your system
         > ollama stop <your_model_choice>                   -->> This will stop your running model
         > ollama rm 
         > ollama ps                                         -->> To check all the LOADED olama models in your system
         > ollama list                                       -->> To check all the available models in your system 

   3) Python library which lets you talk to your local running ollama and your model
            
            > pip install ollama

   4) Next Run this below code in python :

         from ollama import chat
         from ollama import ChatResponse

         response: ChatResponse = chat(model='llama3.2', messages=[
         {
               'role': 'user',
               'content': 'Why is the sky blue?',
         },
         ])
         print(response['message']['content'])
         # or access fields directly from the response object
         print(response.message.content)










##### For Listening

	1) Install "whisper-mic" for live listening from mic .
		Note - "whisper" is from "OPENAI" , but "whisper-mic" is developed by some individual developer 

		> pip install whisper-mic

		Below are DEBUG steps if above cmd raises issue :-
			IF Problem from pyaudio:-
				> sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
				> pip install pyaudio
			
			If problem from python header :-
				> sudo apt-get install python3-dev
			
			If from any build tools :-
				> sudo apt install build-essential































      0) Install "speechrecognition" library of python , it is dependent on "pyaudio" which is in turn dependent on "portaudio.h"
         Note : None of the below packages have been checked by me for any security clearence 

            > sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
            > pip install pyaudio
            > pip install SpeechRecognition
      
      1) Install "pyttsx3" library of python 

            > pip install pyttsx3
